# üß† Brain Tumor Detection 

This project presents an automated system for detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images using the **YOLOv8 object detection model**. It includes a **Flask-based web interface** that allows users to upload medical images and receive real-time tumor detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## üñºÔ∏è Demo

Upload your MRI scan image through the web interface and instantly view the detection results:

- Tumors are highlighted with **bounding boxes**.
- Each detection includes **confidence scores** and **tumor size estimation**.
- Processed image is rendered directly on the result page.
